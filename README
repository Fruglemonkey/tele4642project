This is the TELE4642 Project git page for group 6.

Group 6 consists of:

Jeffrey Lai, Kenny Cheng, Declan Jakrot, and Lewis Shiu.

Here, you'll find the source code and documentation for a multi-home focused load balancer OpenFlow controller.

The controller uses the RYU framework, utilising OpenFlow 1.3 spec.

In order to test and implement this controller, we have used the mininet network virtualisation tool.

Install guides for Ryu and mininet can be found here: https://github.com/osrg/ryu/wiki/OpenFlow_Tutorial
It is highly advised to download and run via a pre-prepared VM, as this will prevent any existing mininet/openvswitch installations from causing conflicts.
